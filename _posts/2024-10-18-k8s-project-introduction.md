## Running your first Kubernetes (k8s) project

We get it—Kubernetes (or K8s for those in the know) is already a widely recognized tool, and for plenty of good reasons. But many people still think it's overly complicated, full of caveats and hurdles. Well, that's kind of true, but the reality is, Kubernetes exists to make things much simpler. Trust me on this.

Once you grasp how it works and the problems it can solve, you'll be amazed.

In this series of posts, I’ll assume you already have a solid understanding of Kubernetes, along with Docker/containers, Unix, and other cool stuffs.

Our first step is to define our main goals. So without further ado, let's dive in.

The ultimate objective here is to get a website running on Kubernetes (K8s) on AWS. Sounds pretty straightforward, right?

However, to reach that point, we need to go through several important steps. We'll start by setting up a local test environment and getting everything running locally. I assure you, it’ll be a professional and engaging journey to get there.

Once that's done, we'll move on to a quick overview of setting up an AWS account, including permissions and automated deployment. In the future, we might even extend this to other cloud providers. And finally, we’ll have everything up and running.

That is great. See you in the next post where we are going to actually start our impossible mission.
