## üöÄ K8s Project - Understanding and Creating a Service - Part V

So, you‚Äôve got your pods running in Kubernetes, your application is alive, and everything seems great! But, let‚Äôs face it‚Äîport forwarding into your cluster every time you want to access the app isn‚Äôt the most user-friendly solution, right? That‚Äôs where **Kubernetes services** come in to save the day! In this post, we‚Äôll walk through the concept of services in Kubernetes, why they‚Äôre awesome, and how to create one for your app. Ready? Let‚Äôs dive in!

### üßê What Is a Service in Kubernetes?

A **service** in Kubernetes is like your app‚Äôs personal receptionist‚Äîit makes sure that your users (and other apps) can access your pods without needing to know exactly where they are. Think of it as a single point of entry that balances traffic across all your app‚Äôs pods. It‚Äôs like Kubernetes saying, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about finding the pods, I got this!‚Äù

But wait, there‚Äôs more! A service also assigns a stable **IP address** and **DNS name** to your app, so even if your pods change, the service remains the same. Pretty neat, right?

### üßë‚Äçüíª Step 1: Let‚Äôs Create a Service

Now, instead of making your users struggle with port forwarding, let‚Äôs create a service that will act as a single point of entry for your app. The service will handle distributing requests between your pods, and users can access your app easily.

In Kubernetes, there are different types of services, but for now, we‚Äôll focus on the most common one: the **ClusterIP** service. This type of service provides an internal, stable IP address that other services and pods within your Kubernetes cluster can use to find your app.

So, here‚Äôs how we create it:

1. **Create the Service YAML file**:
    We‚Äôll use `kubectl` to generate a basic service YAML file, similar to how we created the deployment:

    ```bash
    kubectl create service clusterip myks8project --tcp=80:80 --dry-run=client -o yaml > service.yaml
    ```

    This command creates a service that exposes port **80** from the pods (since our app runs on port 80 inside the container) and maps it to port **80** of the service itself. The `--dry-run=client` flag ensures we just create the YAML without applying it yet. Let‚Äôs open this file and take a look at what we‚Äôve got.

---

### üìú Understanding the Service Manifest

Just like with the deployment, the service also has a manifest that describes its configuration. Here‚Äôs what the generated YAML might look like:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: myks8project
  name: myks8project
spec:
  ports:
  - name: 80-80
    port: 80
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: myks8project
  type: ClusterIP
status:
  loadBalancer: {}
```

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the important parts:

- **apiVersion**: This specifies the API version used to define the service. In this case, it‚Äôs `v1` because we‚Äôre creating a basic service.
- **kind**: It tells Kubernetes what resource we‚Äôre dealing with, which is a **Service**.
- **metadata**: The **name** of the service is `myks8project`.
- **selector**: This is where the magic happens! The selector links the service to the correct set of pods using the `app=myks8project` label. This way, the service knows which pods to route traffic to.
- **ports**: We specify that traffic will come through **port 80** and will be routed to **port 80** on the pods.
- **type**: We‚Äôre using a **ClusterIP** service, which exposes the service only within the cluster.

---

### üîß Step 2: Apply the Service

Now that our service manifest is ready, let‚Äôs apply it and create the service in Kubernetes.

1. **Apply the service**:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f service.yaml
    ```

    If everything goes well, you‚Äôll see a message like:

    ```bash
    service/myks8project created
    ```

2. **Verify the service** by running:

    ```bash
    kubectl get services
    ```

    You should see your service listed with its own **ClusterIP** (the internal IP address Kubernetes has assigned to it).

---

### üéØ Step 3: Testing the Service

Alright, our service is now live and should be routing traffic to our pods. But let‚Äôs confirm that everything is working as expected. Instead of using the deployment name for port forwarding like we did earlier, we‚Äôll now use the service name:

1. **Forward the port using the service**:

    ```bash
    kubectl port-forward service/myks8project 8080:80
    ```

    This command forwards traffic from **localhost:8080** to the service‚Äôs port **80**, which in turn forwards it to the pods.

2. **Test the service**:

    Head to your browser and open:

    ```bash
    http://localhost:8080
    ```

    You should see your **Hello World!!!** website running smoothly! üéâ

### üß† Quick Recap on What We Just Did

We just created a **Kubernetes service**‚Äîa stable, single point of entry for your application inside the Kubernetes cluster. By using the **ClusterIP** type of service, we made sure that traffic can flow seamlessly between your users and the right pods, all without having to deal with port forwarding directly into the cluster every time.

- **Services** provide stable IP addresses and DNS names, making your app accessible to other services and users.
- The **selector** tells the service which pods to route traffic to based on labels.
- The service acts like a smart load balancer for your pods.

Here‚Äôs an improved version of the new section, adding more explanations:

#### üîç Let's Check All We Have Got So Far

At this point, it‚Äôs important to see what resources Kubernetes has created for your app. To do that, we can list all the Kubernetes resources associated with our app using the **label selector** (`-l`). Labels are key in Kubernetes because they allow you to group and filter resources by custom tags (like `app=myks8project`), which is super handy when you want to see everything related to a specific app.

To check all the resources we've created for our app, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl get all -l app=myks8project
```

This command will return all resources (pods, services, deployments, etc.) that have the label `app=myks8project`. You should see something like this:

```bash
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/myks8project-79cd67c7cc-5rfnf   1/1     Running   0          23h

NAME                   TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
service/myks8project   ClusterIP   10.96.46.222   <none>        80/TCP    10m

NAME                           READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/myks8project   1/1     1            1           23h

NAME                                      DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/myks8project-79cd67c7cc   1         1         1       23h
```

Let‚Äôs break down what we‚Äôre seeing:

1. **Pods**:
   - The pod `myks8project-79cd67c7cc-5rfnf` is listed under the `pod/` section, indicating that one replica of our app is currently running (`1/1` under **READY**). This means our app is successfully running inside the Kubernetes cluster.

2. **Service**:
   - The `service/myks8project` entry shows the **ClusterIP** service we created earlier. This service is accessible internally within the cluster through the IP `10.96.46.222` and is exposing port **80**. There‚Äôs no **EXTERNAL-IP** here because we haven‚Äôt set it up for external access yet, which is fine for now.

3. **Deployment**:
   - The deployment `deployment.apps/myks8project` shows that it‚Äôs running 1 pod (1/1 under **READY**) and that everything is up-to-date with no issues.

4. **ReplicaSets**:
   - ReplicaSets manage the pods. Here we see 1 ReplicaSet: (`myks8project-79cd67c7cc`) which has 1 pod running, indicating it‚Äôs the current active ReplicaSet.

Using the `-l app=myks8project` filter is not only useful for viewing all related resources but also helpful for ensuring that your setup is running as expected after applying the manifests. It‚Äôs a great way to troubleshoot if anything looks off.

## üåü Final Thoughts

Congrats! You‚Äôve now leveled up your Kubernetes game by creating a service that manages traffic routing within your cluster. No more manual port forwarding‚Äînow you‚Äôve got a scalable, maintainable way to access your app. üôå

But there‚Äôs more! In the next part, we‚Äôll dive deeper into **ingress controllers**, which take this a step further by exposing your services to the outside world with real domain names. Ready to learn how to make your app publicly accessible? Stay tuned for more Kubernetes adventures!
