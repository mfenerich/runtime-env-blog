## üöÄ K8s Project - Setting Up an Ingress - Part VI

Alright, friends, it‚Äôs time to open the gates and let the world (or at least your local machine) access your Kubernetes services! In this part, we‚Äôll be talking about **Ingress** and how it works as a reverse proxy to provide external access to your Kubernetes resources. Let‚Äôs dive in and explore how we can make your app accessible in a more "production-ready" way.

### üßê What Is an Ingress in Kubernetes?

Picture an Ingress as a sort of fancy bouncer for your Kubernetes cluster. It sits at the door, allowing external traffic to enter your services through a well-defined set of rules. Without an Ingress, you‚Äôd need to expose each service individually or rely on port forwarding‚Äîwhich is a bit like having everyone knock directly on your pod‚Äôs door. Not exactly scalable, right?

If you‚Äôve ever dealt with load balancers (like AWS‚Äôs Application Load Balancer or Azure‚Äôs API Gateway), Ingress will feel quite familiar. But if you haven‚Äôt, don‚Äôt worry! It‚Äôs simply a way to route external traffic (like HTTP requests) to your internal Kubernetes services.

Here‚Äôs the magic: Ingress handles routing traffic based on **rules**‚Äîwhich URL path should go to which service. So, instead of creating complicated routing configurations for each pod or service, Ingress makes it easy to direct traffic across multiple resources. It even allows for advanced rules like regex or prefix matching, but we‚Äôll keep things simple for now. Let's get going!

---

### üßë‚Äçüíª Step 1: Creating an Ingress

Now that we know what an Ingress is, let‚Äôs create one for our application. We‚Äôll define a basic rule to forward all traffic hitting the root of `myks8project` to our `myks8project` service.

1. **Generate the Ingress YAML**:
    Just like we did with the deployment and service manifests, we‚Äôll use `kubectl` to generate the Ingress YAML file:

    ```bash
    kubectl create ingress myks8project --rule="myks8project/*=myks8project:80" --dry-run=client -o yaml > ingress.yaml
    ```

    This command generates an Ingress rule that forwards all traffic from `myks8project` to the service `myks8project` on port **80**.

---

### üìú Understanding the Ingress Manifest

Let‚Äôs open up the generated `ingress.yaml` file and see what we‚Äôve got:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: myks8project
spec:
  rules:
  - host: myks8project
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: myks8project
            port:
              number: 80
        path: /
        pathType: Prefix
status:
  loadBalancer: {}
```

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the important bits:

- **apiVersion**: Specifies the API version for the Ingress object. We‚Äôre using `networking.k8s.io/v1`.
- **kind**: Tells Kubernetes that we‚Äôre creating an **Ingress** resource.
- **rules**: This is where the magic happens! We‚Äôre saying that any HTTP request hitting `myks8project/` should be routed to the `myks8project` service on port **80**.
- **pathType**: We‚Äôve set this to `Prefix`, meaning any traffic to `myks8project/` or subpaths (like `/images`) will be sent to the service.

Pretty neat, right?

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Configuring the Ingress Controller

But wait‚Äîthere‚Äôs one more thing! Before we can actually use the Ingress, we need an **Ingress controller**. This controller is responsible for watching the Ingress rules and directing traffic accordingly. Think of it as the brains behind the Ingress.

1. **Install the NGINX Ingress Controller**:
    Since we‚Äôre using Kind, we‚Äôll follow the official documentation to install the NGINX Ingress controller. Kind makes this easy by providing a one-liner to get it up and running:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/main/deploy/static/provider/kind/deploy.yaml
    ```

    This command applies a pre-configured NGINX Ingress controller manifest from GitHub. It creates everything we need to handle the Ingress routing.

2. **Verify the Installation**:
    After the installation, let‚Äôs check if everything‚Äôs running smoothly. We‚Äôll look at all resources in the `ingress-nginx` namespace:

    ```bash
    kubectl get all -n ingress-nginx
    ```

    If you see a pod for the **Ingress controller** in the running state, we‚Äôre good to go!

    You should see something like this:

    ```bash
    NAME                                            READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
    pod/ingress-nginx-admission-create-2h297        0/1     Completed   0          18s
    pod/ingress-nginx-admission-patch-6qbpj         0/1     Completed   1          18s
    pod/ingress-nginx-controller-7bf576957f-vnf6z   0/1     Running     0          18s

    NAME                                         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
    service/ingress-nginx-controller             NodePort    10.96.250.186   <none>        80:32066/TCP,443:31049/TCP   18s
    service/ingress-nginx-controller-admission   ClusterIP   10.96.98.21     <none>        443/TCP                      18s

    NAME                                       READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    deployment.apps/ingress-nginx-controller   0/1     1            0           18s

    NAME                                                  DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
    replicaset.apps/ingress-nginx-controller-7bf576957f   1         1         0       18s

    NAME                                       COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
    job.batch/ingress-nginx-admission-create   1/1           5s         18s
    job.batch/ingress-nginx-admission-patch    1/1           6s         18s
    ```

---

### üèóÔ∏è Step 3: Apply the Ingress Manifest

Now that the NGINX Ingress controller is in place, it‚Äôs time to apply our `ingress.yaml` file:

```bash
kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml
```

This will create the Ingress resource and make it active. But there‚Äôs one last step to make sure we can actually access it.

---

### üåê Step 4: Map Your Ingress to Localhost

Your Ingress is now live, but we need to make sure `myks8project` actually points to your local machine. Since we don‚Äôt have a real DNS entry for `myks8project`, we‚Äôll simulate one using the `/etc/hosts` file on your computer.

1. **Edit your `/etc/hosts` file** (you‚Äôll need admin or sudo permissions):

    ```bash
    sudo vim /etc/hosts
    ```

2. **Add this line** to map `myks8project` to `localhost`:

    ```bash
    127.0.0.1 myks8project
    ```

This tells your computer that any traffic to `myks8project` should go to `localhost`, which is where your Kubernetes cluster is running.

---

### üéâ Step 5: Test the Ingress

Moment of truth‚Äîlet‚Äôs see if everything‚Äôs working! Open up your browser and go to:

```bash
http://myks8project
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your app running! The Ingress is now handling the routing and directing traffic to your `myks8project` service. üéâ

---

### üîç Let‚Äôs Check What We Have So Far

Before we wrap things up, let‚Äôs review all the resources related to our app. We can use a simple `kubectl` command to list all resources associated with `myks8project`:

```bash
kubectl get all -l app=myks8project
```

This will show the pods, services, deployments, and now the Ingress we‚Äôve just created. You should see something like this:

```bash
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/myks8project-79cd67c7cc-5rfnf   1/1     Running   0          23h

NAME                   TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
service/myks8project   ClusterIP   10.96.46.222   <none>        80/TCP    40m

NAME                           READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/myks8project   1/1     1            1           23h

NAME                                      DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/myks8project-79cd67c7cc   1         1         1       23h
```

Looks like everything is up and running smoothly!

### üßë‚Äçüíª Wrapping Up

And there you have it! We‚Äôve successfully set up an Ingress in Kubernetes, created routing rules, and even faked a DNS entry to make it all work on your local machine. You‚Äôre one step closer to having a fully operational Kubernetes setup!

Next up, we‚Äôll dive into scaling and monitoring your services to make sure your app is ready to handle traffic like a pro. Stay tuned!
