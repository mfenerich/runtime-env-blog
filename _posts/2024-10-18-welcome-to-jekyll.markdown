# Welcome to Feneri.ch!

Hello and welcome to my blog!

My name is Marcel Fenerich and this is a space where I’ll be sharing insights, experiences, and knowledge gathered from years of working in software development and architecture. Whether you're here to learn about backend engineering, explore new technologies, or just curious about the world of programming, I hope you'll find something valuable.

I'll be covering topics like API design, software architecture, cloud technologies, and more, as well as sharing lessons learned from projects I've worked on. Expect a mix of technical deep dives, practical tips, and reflections on the evolving landscape of technology.

Thank you for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy the content! Feel free to reach out or leave a comment—I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals.

Stay tuned for more!
