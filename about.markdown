## 👋 Welcome to My Blog!

Hey there! I’m Marcel Fenerich, a software engineer with over a decade of experience in building systems that are designed to last. Over the years, I’ve navigated a range of industries, solving complex challenges and working on projects that require thoughtful planning and execution.

### 🚀 Why This Blog?

This blog is my personal space where I share insights, tips, and experiences from my journey in the tech world. I’ve always believed in learning through doing, and what better way to solidify that knowledge than by sharing it with others?

Whether you're just getting started in your career or you're a seasoned professional, I hope you find something useful here. My posts aim to simplify concepts, offer practical advice, and hopefully provide a bit of humor along the way—because learning doesn’t have to be boring!

### 🎯 What’s the Focus?

The topics covered here reflect what I’ve encountered in my work and the questions I’ve asked along the way. From big-picture architecture discussions to smaller, day-to-day workflow improvements, I aim to cover things that are relevant, useful, and applicable. I focus on what I’ve found valuable in my own projects, with the hope that it will resonate with others.

### 🌍 A Bit About Me

Currently based in Switzerland, I’ve had the chance to work on projects across different regions and industries. When I’m not immersed in code or architecture diagrams, I enjoy exploring new places and cultures. This curiosity drives me to keep learning and growing, both professionally and personally.
